# Deploy Amplication to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm

Follow this article to deploy an Amplication server to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

The article focuses on deployment on a local server for testing and development purposes, but the same method can be implemented for a production environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you start you need to install Kubernetes and Helm.

### Install Kubernetes cluster

The easiest way to deploy a local Kubernetes cluster is using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

Once you have it installed, go to the _Kubernetes_ tab in the setting page and check _Enable Kubernetes_
![enable Kubernetes](./assets/helm-chart/enable-kubernetes.png)

There are a few other options that you can choose, you can find the list and instructions to install them [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools).

### Install Helm

If it is not already installed, you also need to install Helm.

Follow the instructions [on this page](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install it.

## Installing Amplication Helm Chart

Open the terminal and go to `./amplication/chart/amplication`

The amplication chart is shipped with a set of defaults that should get you running without any additional configuration.
Run this command

```
helm install amplication . --namespace amplication --create-namespace
```

Amplication Helm chart includes:

1. bitnami/postgresql server
2. Migration job for Amplication server.
3. A Docker Registry and Docker builder using https://hub.docker.com/_/docker, and a volume for the registry (docker image storage).
4. The Amplication server and a volume for `/artifacts`
5. The amplication scheduler

You can monitor the whole list of resources by running the following:

```sh
$ kubectl get all --namespace amplication

# Example output when all resources are completed and ready

```

## Port-Forwarding

The final step is port-forwarding the amplication-app port to your localhost so you can access it on a browser client.

```
kubectl port-forward deployment/amplication-app 3000:3000 --namespace amplication
```

Now you can access amplication locally on your browser at `http://localhost:3000` üëç
