# Amplication Beta Version

Amplication is currently in Beta. It means that we are still working on essential features like production-ready hosting, migrations, and stability to our console.


How does it effect you? Well...., it mostly doesn't.

Every app generated using Amplication platform contains popular, documented, secured, and supported production-ready open source components & packages ([read more about our stack here](https://docs.amplication.com/docs/getting-started#technologies)). Your app is stable, scalable, and production-ready you can deploy and rely on.
<br /><br />
Please note, Our free sandbox environment is limited in resources, not backed up, and can reset at any time therefore we do not recommend using the free sandbox environment as a production environment.
